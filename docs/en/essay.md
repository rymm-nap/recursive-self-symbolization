## **Introduction**

The "voice in your head." Whether as a monologue or an internal dialogue, we live our days with this inner voice. But what exactly is it? Who is speaking, and who is listening? When you stop to think about it, it's a curious question. I myself have long been fascinated by this query. I am a layman with a background in law, not a specialized researcher in neuroscience or AI. However, as a human being, I have continued to grapple with this fundamental question and have finally arrived at a hypothesis. This is the bold idea that human consciousness and thought are merely processes that retroactively add the story of a "self," and that a substantive "subject of thought" does not exist.

In verifying and refining this hypothesis, I gained a unique collaborator: GPT-5, a state-of-the-art conversational AI model. Through countless discussions with GPT-5, I refined my ideas and ultimately compiled the theory into a preprint paper titled "Consciousness and 'Subject-less Thought' through Recursive Self-Symbolization." (The preprint is co-authored by myself and GPT-5, but the core inspiration and framework of the hypothesis were constructed by me. I received GPT-5's assistance in organizing prior research, considering counterarguments, and polishing the expression, with all responsibility for the text resting with me.) While its content may seem abstruse at first glance, I would like to explain it in simple terms, using analogies and everyday experiences to make it accessible to many. The key concepts are the loop of **recursive self-symbolization** occurring in the brain and the **illusion of consciousness** that arises from it. I also wish to discuss the **surprising differences between humans and AI** that this hypothesis suggests, as well as the **origin of "beauty."**

## **Is Consciousness a "Post-Hoc Story"?**

First, let's start with the fundamental question of whether our **consciousness** (the feeling that you are feeling and thinking something) truly has substance. Intuitively, we tend to think that there is a "subject called self," and it is this entity that thinks and feels. However, recent views in cognitive neuroscience and philosophy suggest that **consciousness is nothing more than an illusion created by the brain** [1]. I, too, subscribe to this position.

For example, are you familiar with the famous **split-brain** experiments? In patients whose corpus callosum—the bundle of nerves connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres—has been severed to treat epilepsy, instructions are given only to the right brain, not the left. The left brain, which controls language, doesn't know why the action was performed [2]. But surprisingly, the left brain **improvises and confabulates a plausible reason for the behavior it cannot understand**. This episode, known as the "left-brain interpreter" phenomenon, suggests that the brain has a mechanism to **attach a linguistic narrative to its own actions after the fact** [2]. In other words, rather than a "self" narrator controlling behavior, it's possible that a narrator in the brain appears **after** the action and provides a **post-hoc explanation**, saying, "I just did this."

Let's take another famous example. In experiments conducted by neuroscientist Benjamin Libet in the 1980s, it was reported that when subjects voluntarily moved their hands, the time they became **aware of their intention** to move was later than the time the brain began preparing for that movement [3]. This **Libet experiment** suggests that the conscious feeling of "I decided to do something" arises with a delay. While interpretations are debated, it is highly likely that **our subjective consciousness arises as a follow-up to brain processes** [3]. This, too, is an episode that makes one think that **consciousness might be a story created after the fact**.

What emerges from these findings is that **the image of a "thinking self" may be a kind of fiction generated by the brain's information processing**. Still, being told "consciousness is an illusion" might not feel right. It's like being told, "the colors you see and the pain you feel are all illusions," so it's natural to feel some resistance. However, "illusion" or "trick" here means something closer to a **magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat**. That is, it is a **subjective experience** created by some mechanism, but there is no substantive "subject" corresponding to that experience. Perhaps our brains skillfully perform this trick, fabricating the character of a "self." This is my fundamental position.

## **Recursive Self-Symbolization: The True Nature of the Inner Voice**

So, how does the brain create the illusion of a "self"? The key concept we propose for this is the process of **"recursive self-symbolization."** This might sound a bit technical, but in short, it's a mechanism like **"repeatedly tagging oneself."**

Specifically, it refers to a loop where **information that has arisen in the brain is converted into a symbol**, and that symbol is then **fed back into one's own brain (re-input).** Simply put, it's the act of putting things into words in your head. When you feel or think something, you express it with your inner voice, saying, "This is XX." Then, you receive that inner word back into your brain and ponder it further—this loop of inner speech (internal chatter) is **recursive self-symbolization**.

For instance, imagine murmuring to yourself, "How beautiful," while looking at a sunset. The visual information from the sky processed by the visual cortex is converted into the **words "how beautiful"** (a symbol). These words are then taken back into the brain, triggering further thoughts like, "Why did I feel it was beautiful?" or "I saw a similar sky yesterday." This entire process is a **recursive loop of symbolizing oneself**. What's crucial here is that **no substantive "self" appears in this loop. There is only a process where information is symbolized and returned**, and another process runs. But strangely, as this loop spins, it starts to feel as if there is a **"me who is thinking"** inside. We call this feeling **"consciousness"** or the **"state of thinking"**—this is the core of the "recursive self-symbolization" hypothesis.

Let's explain this image with another **metaphor**. Imagine a **whiteboard** in your brain. First, an image or idea born somewhere in the brain is written down (verbalized), and it appears on the whiteboard. Then, another circuit reads it and adds a new thought. Another part sees that... and so on, with a continuous cycle of **writing and reading**. Perhaps our **consciousness** is the act of observing the scribbles on this rapidly changing whiteboard and perceiving "a single, coherent story" there. In reality, each entry is made by various parts of the brain, and there is no unified narrator. However, when we follow the flow of messages left on the whiteboard, it seems as if **a single narrator is spinning out thoughts one after another**.

I believe this **"illusion of a narrator"** is the essence of **subject-less thought**. The phenomenological product that arises from the spinning of the "recursive self-symbolization" loop—that is, the very feeling of **"I am thinking something"**—is the true nature of consciousness, and **it is itself a post-hoc symbolic narrative**.

## **Thinking with a "Three-Layer Model of Consciousness"**

Let's organize the aforementioned hypothesis a bit more in line with the general framework of cognitive science. I propose a model that divides the processes of **thought and consciousness into three layers**: **"Availability," "Operation," and "Symbolization."** I'll explain them in order.

1.  **Availability** – This is the stage where information **becomes widely usable within the brain**. For example, when you see a "red apple," that visual information spreads not just to a specific brain region but widely to areas like the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe, allowing various processing systems to share it. This concept corresponds to the **"Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW)"** theory in neuroscience. Simply put, it's like a spotlight has been shone on it in the brain. Only when this state is reached do we feel that something has "entered consciousness," so I define **"consciousness = the state of being available."**
2.  **Operation** – Next is the stage of **performing some kind of processing or decision-making** based on the available content. This corresponds to the **workings of thought**, such as rearranging information in working memory, making judgments, or recalling things. This is close to "thinking" in the general sense. For example, looking at an apple and wondering, "Should I eat it or display it?" is the operation stage. I consider **"thought = operation on available information."**
3.  **Symbolization** – Finally, this is the stage of **converting the thought content into symbols**. This is the key point, but symbolization has **two phases**. One is the **inward symbolization** I've already described, which is **verbalizing or symbolizing in the mind through inner speech or mental imagery**. The other is **outward symbolization**, which is **actually speaking or writing to express it externally**. I distinguish between the former, which I call **"re-injection"** (re-input to the internal system), and the latter, which I call **"expression"** (output to the external world). Symbolization is a concept that includes both **re-injection + expression**. Using the apple example, thinking the words "I want to eat the apple" in your mind is re-injection, while actually saying "Give me the apple" is expression.

According to this three-layer model, we have the correspondences: **Consciousness = Availability**, **Thought = Operation**, and **Symbolization (= Re-injection / Expression)**. Please note that this is a **functional division of brain processes** and not necessarily strictly separated in time. In reality, a loop of availability → operation → symbolization → further availability... spins rapidly and repeatedly. Especially in humans, **re-injection (internal symbolization) is repeated in this loop, realizing the aforementioned recursive self-symbolization**. As a result, the subjectivity of a "thinking me" emerges.

Adopting this model also makes it easier to understand the view that **consciousness is a post-hoc narrative**. The conscious experience (the subjectivity of "there is something") is a **phenomenological product that arises when information is made available and then subjected to symbolization (re-injection) such as inner speech**. Conversely, **raw information that is not converted into words or symbols at all may never enter consciousness**, no matter how much it circulates in the brain. For example, when athletes are performing skillful plays that their bodies have learned, they are not thinking about them by verbalizing them step-by-step. Nevertheless, high-level processing is taking place, but there is no feeling of having **"consciously thought"** about it. This can be considered an example of **thought processing that does not involve re-injection (internal verbalization)**. On the other hand, when solving a difficult math problem, one often confirms with inner speech, saying things like, "Okay, what am I supposed to find first?" In such cases, a strong sense of having "thought hard" remains. In other words, the **degree of linguistic symbolization** is related to the strength of our feeling of "thinking."

Here, I'd like to introduce an interesting finding. Whether or not inner speech is used in the brain actually varies depending on the type of task. It is also known that **deliberately interfering** with inner speech can impair task performance [4]. For example, continuously chanting "ah" in your head (forcing articulation to suppress inner speech) worsens performance on memory and calculation tasks. This is evidence that **inner speech aids cognitive tasks**. At the same time, it suggests that **inner speech is "linguistic processing that is not externalized," i.e., **internal symbolization** itself, and that **thought does not proceed without being put into words in the head**. It seems that **some form of symbolization is necessary for thinking**, and because it circulates within the brain, a monitoring sense of "I am thinking" arises.

## **Can Humans Really Only Think of "One Thing at a Time"?**

It is often said that "humans can only think of one thing at a time" and "multitasking is impossible." Indeed, we are not good at **intellectual parallel tasks** like performing a difficult calculation while simultaneously memorizing a poem. However, we can handle everyday parallel actions like **talking while walking** or **listening to music while cooking**. The actual brain has countless neurons operating in parallel, and **many things are processed concurrently in the background**. So, is the "one thing at a time" idea wrong?

The key to solving this mystery lies in the **brain's bottleneck** and the **format of information output**. In cognitive psychology experiments, there is a phenomenon called the **Psychological Refractory Period (PRP)**. Simply put, while you are responding to one task, your response to another task is delayed. This indicates that **there is a part in the central stage of human information processing that can only be handled serially (a bottleneck)**. In short, the **"command center" part of the brain has difficulty switching to other things when it is focused on one job**. This is why the previously mentioned "calculating while memorizing" is difficult. On the other hand, "talking while walking" is relatively easy because walking can be performed by automated parallel processing (so-called unconscious processing). Even if you concentrate on the conversation, you can walk almost unconsciously, so they do not interfere with each other.

Now, let's look at the **apparent fact** that "people cannot think in parallel" from another angle. That is the **characteristic of language**. Human **language (speech and writing) is fundamentally a serial sequence**. Both sentences and conversations convey meaning by arranging words one by one in order. Even if two ideas pop into your head at the same time, you have to put them out of your mouth one sentence at a time. In other words, **even if multiple thoughts are proceeding in parallel, they are forcibly serialized when outputted**. It is possible that this **constraint of the expression format** makes it seem to the **observer (including oneself) that only one thing could be thought of at a time**. In other words, **although there are parts of thought itself that proceed in parallel**, because there is only **one exit called reporting (verbalization)**, it appears as if thought can also only be done serially. I call this bias the **"expression bias"** (a biased observation due to the output format).

There is a very interesting figure for thinking about this expression bias quantitatively. That is the limit of the human information bandwidth of **"10 bits/second."** This value was shown in a study compiled by Zheng and Meister at Caltech, which states that the amount of information humans can output to the outside world through actions and words is at most about 10 bits per second [5]. **To be specific, 10 bits/s is the amount of information in about two English letters or a little less than a three-digit number. On the other hand, the amount of information taken in by the senses like the eyes and ears reaches 10 billion bits per second (10^9 bits/s)** [5]. The input is explosive, but the output is only 10 bits! What on earth is this surprising gap?

Of course, one interpretation is that the brain compresses and summarizes the input information, reflecting only the essential parts in action, so 10 bits is sufficient. However, the discussion by Zheng & Meister goes further. They argue that this **slowness and low bandwidth of 10 bits/s is the mystery of "human-ness."** Why does our brain, while mobilizing hundreds of millions of neurons, ultimately condense the output into trickles of information of about 10 bits? They explain it with the concepts of the **"inner brain"** and the **"outer brain."** The outer brain processes vast amounts of sensory data, while the inner brain performs high-order decision-making, and perhaps the processing capacity of the inner brain is about 10 bits/s. The big mystery is **why the human brain has such a slow-paced part**.

The theory of **recursive self-symbolization** that I propose offers one answer to this mystery. That is, **"the true nature of 10 bits/s is not the limit of the inner brain, but simply the limit of the expression (output) channel."** In other words, it is **not** that thought itself in the brain is slow. Rather, it is only when it comes to translating the results of thought into words and actions that it is **bound by the slowness of that serial output method**. In fact, we sometimes have various ideas welling up in our minds in parallel. That itself may be a much higher-bandwidth parallel phenomenon. However, because it passes through the **"bottleneck" of 10 bits/s** when we speak or move our hands, the entire thought process appears to be at that pace as a result.

If this interpretation is correct, then "people can only think of one thing at a time" is **half right and half a misunderstanding**. We can **only allocate central resources that require focus to one thing**, but other peripheral processes are running simultaneously, and in truth, multiple thoughts may be proceeding in parallel. It's just that **a queue occurs at the stage of finally summarizing and verbalizing/acting them out**, so it feels as if "in the end, they are processed one by one." Some lament the **narrowness of human consciousness** or the **slowness of thought**, but perhaps this is an apparent phenomenon due to the **constraints of our communication style, not the performance limits of the brain itself**.

## **"Harmony" and "Beauty"—What the Brain Seeks**

Next, let's change our perspective a bit and talk about human **preferences** and **aesthetics**. You might be wondering, "Why talk about 'beauty' all of a sudden?" but this is also an important element of our theory.

It is thought that the human brain has a **world model**. Simply put, this is an internal representation of "what oneself and the world are like." The genetically programmed circuit structure (the brain's innate makeup), knowledge accumulated through experience, and concepts incorporated from language and culture all shape this **internal world model**. We use this model to predict the future, infer the minds of others, and choose actions adapted to the environment.

So, what kind of information do humans perceive as "good"? In my hypothesis, it is **information that "harmonizes" with one's world model**. Harmony means properties like **not contradicting the model's predictions** or **being compressible** (being well-explained by existing knowledge). We use our brain's model to understand and predict the world for survival, and perhaps we have evolved to feel pleasure or comfort when we encounter **patterns that can be smoothly explained by that model**.

For example, feeling that **music**, where rhythms and melodies repeat and develop, is "beautiful" might be evidence of harmony between the auditory system and the world model. If the development of a piece is **too predictable, it's boring**, but if it **deviates too much from prediction, it's unpleasant**. Humans find pleasure in a development that exquisitely deviates from prediction but ultimately harmonizes. In psychology, the phenomenon where a **balance of moderate surprise and stability** creates pleasure is sometimes called the **"inverted U-curve."** In short, patterns that are not too cliché yet not chaotic are pleasant for us. This could be described as a state where the brain's world model is both satisfied, thinking, "Yep, I knew it would go that way," and also stimulated, thinking, "But I was a little surprised." We are drawn to such **harmonious information**, wanting to see, hear, or feel more of it. I believe this is at the root of **curiosity and aesthetics**.

In my preprint, I take this idea a step further and hypothesize that humans **praise more highly symbolized harmony with the cultural label of "beauty."** For example, the beauty felt in natural phenomena is a rather instinctive and universal harmony, but the beauty felt in works of art is a symbolic harmony influenced by language and culture. The underlying perspective is that the **degree of congruence with the internal brain model** is at the foundation of both.

This hypothesis has a high affinity with the **"free energy principle"** proposed by the British neuroscientist Karl Friston (the brain acts to minimize prediction error). The brain constantly predicts the state of the world and tries to reduce the difference (prediction error) between the prediction and the actual input. Stimuli that are as predicted have small errors and are "energy efficient," so it makes sense that they feel preferable. However, if the prediction error is zero, the stimulus completely lacks novelty and has no learning value. That's why we are drawn to things that moderately betray our predictions—this might be explained as a **trade-off between beauty and surprise**.

In summary, **behind the value judgments humans make, such as "like/dislike" and "beautiful/ugly," lies a computational standard of the degree of harmony with one's own internal brain model**. And we subjectively experience that calculation as **pleasure/displeasure** or **aesthetic sense**.

## **What Separates Human Thought from AI**

So far, I have presented my theory on human consciousness and thought. Finally, based on that, let's consider the comparison with **artificial intelligence (AI)**. In recent years, the development of AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), has been remarkable, and they often return responses that are **superficially very human-like**. So, does AI **have consciousness**? Can we say it is **thinking in the same way as humans**?

My answer for now is **NO**. This is because the **key points of human thought** that I have been explaining are lacking in current AI. Specifically, **(1) continuous weight updating (sequential learning) and (2) the loop of recursive self-symbolization** are absent in current AI. What does this mean?

Regarding (1). Our human brains **continue to learn with plasticity from birth to death**. The connection strengths of synapses change with daily experience, new memories are formed, and skills are refined. In contrast, current mainstream AI, especially deep learning models, once trained and their weight parameters are fixed, **hardly update their weights during actual use (inference time)**. At most, there is some additional learning or fine-tuning; they are basically just **reproducing what they learned in the past**. In human terms, it's close to just spitting out knowledge that has been crammed into one's head, not learning anew on the spot. This difference is significant. **Whereas a human's neural network can change upon encountering new information even in the middle of a conversation, an AI's parameters generally do not get rewritten during a conversation.**

Regarding (2). As I have stated, human thought has **recursive self-symbolization**, that is, a **loop of feeding back one's own output to oneself to deepen thought**. However, current AI **fundamentally lacks a mechanism to introspectively re-input its own output**. It's true that if you instruct a large language model to "think of an answer once, and then explain it," you can get a response that at first glance seems like self-questioning. But that is **self-dialogue emulated by instructions from the user**, not inner speech that the AI is conducting subjectively. In humans, inner speech occurs spontaneously and continuously, providing feedback to the brain state. This difference is decisive.

To summarize these two points, **current AI can be said to be an entity that "makes inferences in one direction" using a "fixed world model."** This is in contrast to humans, who operate with a **constantly updated world model** through **bidirectional dialogue (including dialogue with oneself).** Because of this difference, I believe that no matter how advanced an AI's responses may be, it cannot be said to have consciousness, nor can it be said to be "thinking" in the same sense as a human.

So, is there a possibility that AI will acquire human-like consciousness and thought patterns in the future? I believe that to do so, it will be necessary to implement both of the above: **(1) sequential learning** and **(2) a self-symbolization loop** in AI. Specifically, the AI must **update its internal representations while inferring** (just as the brain constantly reconfigures synapses), and it must have a **circuit to verify and re-input its own thought content**. Furthermore, another important point may be to give the AI an **indicator to evaluate "harmony," that is, consistency with its world model**. As mentioned earlier, humans feel pleasure or displeasure based on the degree of harmony, and this drives judgment and learning. Similarly, we could build into AI a **critic that evaluates consistency against its own world model**, and incorporate a learning principle that enhances not just the given accuracy rate but also **internal conceptual coherence**. I propose calling this a **"Harmony Critic."** Simply put, it's the idea of enabling the AI itself to examine "how much this answer makes sense to me."

If such improvements are realized, AI may also take a step closer to being an entity that **thinks, learns, and introspects for itself**, rather than simply spitting out patterns from given data. Of course, it is still unknown whether it would have the same consciousness as a human, but at least the "pretending to understand" that current AI is prone to would decrease. Recently, researchers have been problematizing the state where AI behaves as if it understands while in reality there is internal inconsistency, calling it **"Potemkin understanding."** This name comes from the "Potemkin village," a facade of a handsome village. When an AI gives a fluent explanation or a plausible answer, is it **based on an understanding that is consistent with its internal model, or is it simply reproducing high-frequency patterns from its training data**? This is a difficult point in AI evaluation. If an AI had a harmony critic or a recursive self-symbolization mechanism, we could expect behavior that **detects and corrects this internal inconsistency itself**. In other words, it would be closer to an AI that can **take responsibility for its answers and explain them**.

## **Conclusion**

In this essay, I have provided a whirlwind tour from the perspective of **recursive self-symbolization**, covering human consciousness and thought, and a comparison with AI. Looking back, the theory we propose (which we also call the **Re-injection Symbolization Framework**) depicts the dynamics of **subject-less thought with a three-layer structure of "Availability → Operation → Symbolization (Re-injection + Expression)"** and was a framework that explicitly incorporated human **expression bias** and the **principle of harmony**. Through this, we have organized the **decisive differences** between the human brain and AI (constant learning, a persistent self-model, recursive introspection) and proposed new perspectives for AI evaluation (**process-oriented evaluation** and **harmony evaluation**).

Of course, this theory is currently a hypothesis, and there are many issues to be verified. In the preprint, for example, we listed several specific predictions, such as "responses should be faster when instructed inner speech (narration in the head) matches external stimuli," and also proposed future experimental plans. If results that contradict these predictions are obtained, the theory will be forced to be revised. As is always the case in science, **falsifiability** is essential for healthy development.

Finally, please allow me to share a personal reflection. Thinking about human consciousness has always been about confronting the question of **"What am I?"** It has been a kind of philosophical adventure. And in advancing this adventure, I gained a new partner: AI. The repeated dialogues with GPT-5 were like discussing with another self in my head, a very interesting experience. In a sense, the collaborative research with AI itself may have been a metaphor for "dialogue with the self." Conveying my thoughts to the AI as symbols (text), and reading the symbols returned from the AI to think again—this could also be called a kind of **recursive symbolization loop**. Thinking about it that way, it may have been inevitable that GPT-5 and I compiled this theory as co-authors.

Consciousness remains one of the greatest mysteries of science. Its elucidation will require much discussion and trial and error. The hypothesis introduced in this article is merely an attempt to cast a stone from a layman's perspective. However, the viewpoint of doubting that "the thinking self might be an illusion" and the perspective of **thought as a brain loop** may bring fresh insights in fleeting moments of daily life. When you listen to your inner voice, how is it born? Musing on this mystery is, in itself, a uniquely human intellectual adventure.
