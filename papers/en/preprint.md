## Abstract (Japanese)
This paper formulates consciousness and thinking as **recursive self-symbolization**: a loop where internal tokenization, such as inner speech and mental imagery, is "reinjected" into one's own perception, attention, and decision-making. The cognitive process is broken down into three layers: **Availability (GNW-like ignition/broadcast) → Operations → Symbolization**. Symbolization is treated as a **two-phase** process consisting of **inward reinjection** and **outward expression**. The fact that the effective bandwidth of human action and reporting is constrained to approximately **10 bit/s** is reinterpreted not as a limit on thought itself, but as an **upper bound of the expression channel**. Furthermore, a working hypothesis is presented that **consistency with a world model (harmony)** is a computational property that supports preference and pleasure (aesthetics). For AI, the paper proposes the introduction of a **reinjection loop**, a **Harmony-Critic**, and **process-centric evaluation** (measuring conceptual consistency). The theory is characterized by (i) placing **reinjection** of symbols as a core operation, (ii) incorporating the correction of **output bias** into its evaluation principles, and (iii) specifying **falsifiable predictions**.

## Abstract (English)
We formulate consciousness and thinking as **recursive self-symbolization**: internally generated tokens (inner speech, imagery) are **reinjected** into one’s own perceptual/attentional/decision systems. Cognition is decomposed into **availability** (GNW-like ignition/broadcast), **operations**, and **symbolization**, the latter bifurcating into **internal reinjection** and **external expression**. The empirical **~10 bit/s** limit of human behavior/report primarily reflects the **output channel**, not an intrinsic cap on thinking. We further hypothesize that **harmony**—computational consistency with one’s world model—underlies preference and aesthetic pleasure. For AI, we recommend an **inner reinjection loop**, a **Harmony-Critic**, and **process-centric evaluation** (concept-consistency tests). The contribution centers reinjection, corrects output-induced observational bias, and states **falsifiable predictions**.

## 0. Position & Scope
**Position** - **We do not assume the self as a constant central entity.** The sensation of "I am thinking" is a **phenomenological product** of the reinjection loop.  
- **Consciousness ≈ Availability / Thinking ≈ Operations / Symbolization ≈ Reinjection + Expression.** We avoid strong equivalence, using the qualifier "in many situations."  
- **Approx. 10 bit/s** is the upper limit of **expression**, not the upper limit of **internal processing**.

**Scope In**: Access consciousness (GNW-like global availability), recursive self-symbolization, output bias, harmony principle, adult neurotypical behavior.  
**Scope Out**: Metaphysical resolution of qualia, adjudication of superiority among theories like IIT/HOT, generalization to non-humans/infants (reserved).

## Box 1. Definitions (RSF: Reinjected Symbolization Framework)
- **Availability (Awareness/Access)**: A state where a part of local parallel computation **ignites** and is **broadcast** to the fronto-parietal network, becoming **available** to multiple systems (GNW).  
- **Operations (Thinking)**: **Working manipulations and decision-making** on the available content.  
- **Symbolization**: The mapping of content to **discrete tokens**.  
  - **Reinjection (internal)**: The inward process of **feeding back** inner speech, mental imagery, self-labels, etc., into **one's own sensory/attentional/decision systems**.  
  - **Expression (external)**: The outward process of **releasing into the world** as speech, writing, gestures, or actions.  
- **Understanding (working definition)**: A state where the result of availability + operations can be **stably reinjected/expressed** in a task-relevant manner.

---

## Box 2. World Model (Operational Definition)
**World Model** = A **generative predictive mechanism** consisting of 〈**S**tructure, **W**eights, **Z**-state, **L**earning rules, **E**xternal symbols〉.  
- **S**: Anatomical connections, recurrent loops  
- **W**: Long-term memory (statistics, regularities)  
- **Z**: Instantaneous latent state (context, goals, attention, interoception; ms–s)  
- **L**: Plasticity update rules (error/reward/neuromodulation)  
- **E**: **External symbols** such as language, diagrams, notes, tools (a major source of reinjection in RSF)  

**Harmony** = High **predictive consistency + compressibility (MDL)** in light of the above model. However, due to a balance with **novelty**, **pleasure likely follows an inverted U-shape**.

---

## Box 3. "Operations (Thinking)" Primitives (Minimal Catalog)
**Selection / Maintenance & Updating / Binding / Transformation / Retrieval / Sequence Generation / Constraint Satisfaction / Comparison & Evaluation / Simulation / Inhibition & Competition Resolution / Credit Assignment / Meta-control (gain, granularity, depth) / Narrativization**.  
These operate **recursively and in parallel** within the **Availability → Operation → Reinjection → Re-availability** loop, forming the "feeling of thinking."

**Examples** - **Mental Arithmetic (27+58)**: Decomposition → Sequence generation → **Reinjection of the carry via inner speech** → Consistency check → Expression  
- **Route Planning**: Retrieval → Constraint satisfaction → Simulation → Satisficing → Expression  
- **Counterfactual Thinking**: Re-representation → Rollout → Attribution → **Narrativization (post-hoc)**

## 1. Background: 10 bit/s and Output Bias
While sensory input has a high bandwidth, human **action and reporting** are generally constrained to **tens of bit/s (typically ~10 bit/s)**. This is not an **internal limit of thought**, but an **observational bias** created by the **serial nature of expression channels** like language and the **central bottleneck (PRP)** that becomes apparent in dual-task paradigms.

---

## 2. Temporal Dynamics: Ignition → Recursive Self-Symbolization → "Something is There"
When a part of local parallel processing **ignites** and is **broadcast** (GNW), it triggers **recursive self-symbolization** (inner speech, self-labels, imagery) for that content, which is then **reinjected "as if" it were input**. This **content- and time-selective** positive feedback (approx. 100–800 ms) gives rise to the **selfless** phenomenology of "something is there" or "I am thinking."  
Related known effects: **label-feedback** (language immediately modifies perception), **verbal overshadowing** (verbalization impairs non-verbal memory), and **auditory cortex suppression during self-talk** (prediction/corollary discharge).

---

## 3. The Seriality of Expression and a Reinterpretation of 10 bit/s
Language and reports are **serial streams**, and **stubborn interference** occurs at the **response selection stage** of the PRP. This creates the impression that "people cannot **think** in parallel," but in reality, **numerous parallel processes** are running underneath. **10 bit/s** is the **upper limit of expression**, not the **upper limit of thought**.

---

## 4. Harmony and Aesthetics (Working Hypothesis)
Humans perceive patterns that are **consistent and compressible** in light of their **world model** as **pleasurable**. When novelty is excessive, consistency breaks down; when it is insufficient, boredom sets in. Therefore, **pleasure follows an inverted U-shape**. This is consistent with perspectives of **prediction error minimization** and the **exploration-exploitation tradeoff**.

---

## 5. Human-AI Contrast and Design Principles
- **Humans**: Possess a **persistent self-model** (the combination of S,W,Z,L,E) and **plasticity (sequential weight updates)**, as well as **recursive self-symbolization**.  
- **Current AI**: Hardly updates weights during inference, relying on **pseudo-reinjection** via short-term memory. Lacking the combination of a **persistent self-model × reinjection**, it does not possess **consciousness**. However, it can generate behavior that **appears conscious** through iterative input.

**Design Proposals (Summary)** - **Inner Loop (Reininjector)**: Reinjects intermediate symbols (definitions, summaries, counter-examples) as **self-input**.  
- **Outer Loop (Expressor)**: Final output for the user.  
- **Harmony-Critic**: Evaluates **consistency with the world model** using a composite score of **self-contradiction rate, description length (MDL), consequence consistency, and external knowledge verification**.  
- **Learning**: Even with fixed weights, use **low-learning-rate online adaptation** via **LoRA/Adapters/Memory**.  
- **Evaluation**: Standardize **process supervision** and **conceptual consistency tests** to detect and reduce **Potemkin Understanding** (superficial understanding).

---

## 6. Falsifiable Predictions (Differential Hypotheses)
- **P1 (Content/Time-Selectivity of Reinjection)**: In conditions where instructed **inner speech** **matches** an external stimulus, reaction time will shorten / accuracy will increase, and the opposite will occur with a mismatch (within a short time window).  
- **P2 (Dual-Layer Prediction of Bandwidth and Seriality)**: Using **multiple modalities** like voice + sketching will **increase information/second**, but **PRP interference will persist**.  
- **P3 (Duality of Labeling Effects)**: In tasks with ambiguous categories, **labels will be advantageous**; in tasks requiring discrimination of individual features, **verbalization will be disadvantageous** (overshadowing).  
- **P4 (Expression Deficit ≠ Operational Deficit)**: Some **operations** are **preserved** even in aphasia (requires replication/synthesis).  
- **P5 (Variability of the Self-Model)**: Switching **self-labels** between first-person ↔ third-person will systematically alter **self-attribution and confidence**.

**Retraction Conditions (Examples)**: No **consistent difference** emerges for P1–P3 / **PRP interference completely disappears** with modality combination / No **detectable effect** in P5.

## 7. Minimal Experimental Designs (Within the Scope of Not Requiring Behavioral/Ethical Review)
- **E1** Inner speech vs. External sound match/mismatch (RT, accuracy; EEG/MEG optional) — to estimate the short time window.  
- **E2** Label presence/absence vs. Task structure (ambiguous categories vs. individual features) — to reproduce the dual effects.  
- **E3** Approximate expression bit/s (voice/keyboard/sketch/combined) — to simultaneously verify bandwidth increase and persistent interference.  
- **E4** Self-label switching (1st-person ↔ 3rd-person) — to measure changes in self-attribution and confidence.  

(Procedures briefly described in Appendix B)

## 8. Limitations and Future Work
- **This theory is from an operational and functional standpoint**; the essential nature of qualia is outside its scope.  
- **Relationship with GNW/Predictive Processing**: GNW is a theory of **availability**; RSF emphasizes the **functional linkage** of **Availability → Operations → Symbolization (two-phase)**.  
- **Limits of Generalization**: Extension to non-humans, infants, and clinical populations requires separate validation.  

---

## 9. Conclusion
**RSF** is a framework that describes the temporal dynamics of **selfless thinking** in three layers plus two phases—**Availability → Operations → Symbolization (Reinjection/Expression)**—and explicitly incorporates **output bias** and the **harmony principle**. It clarifies the **critical differences** between humans and AI (persistent self-model × plasticity × reinjection) and contributes to reducing **superficial understanding** through **process-centric evaluation** and a **Harmony-Critic**.
